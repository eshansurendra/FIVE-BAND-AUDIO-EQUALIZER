# README - Opening `Final_Schematic_Grp2.ms14` with NI Multisim

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have NI Multisim installed on your computer. This guide assumes you are using NI Multisim version 14.0 or later. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [NI's official website](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/electronic-test-instrumentation/application-software-for-electronic-test-and-instrumentation/ni-multisim.html) or consult your institution for licensing information.

   - Select `Final_Schematic_Grp2.ms14` and click `Open`.

3. **View and Edit the Schematic**:
   - With the file now open, you can view and edit the schematic as necessary. Use the zoom tools for a better view and edit components or wiring as needed.

4. **Simulation (Optional)**:
   - To simulate the schematic, go to `Simulate` on the menu bar and select the type of simulation you want to run (e.g., Transient Analysis, AC Analysis).
